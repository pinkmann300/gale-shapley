# gale-shapley
The purpose of this repository is to house a mathematically correct implementation of the Gale Shapley Algorithm which is used to solve the Stable Matching problem. The definition of the problem and the motivation for the same can be found in the very first chapter of the book "Algorithm Design" by Eva Tardos & Jon Kleinberg. 

The repository currently houses a Python implementation which follows a very functional approach but concerns over scalability and memory overhead is forcing me towards an imperative implementation. 
While functional implementations are usually made in a language like Haskell or Racket, I hope to study the Python code and make more changes to it to improve efficiency.
